# Lilypad Express
Lilypad Express uses Express.js and MongoDB to create the GET, POST, PATCH,
and DELETE requests that make up Lilypad Client's token authentication process
and its notes resources.
Requests to change, view, or add notes must be made by a signed in user and said
user must be the owner of any notes they wish to view, edit, or delete.

## Technologies used
Express.js, and MongoDB

## Future of the project
The user routes currently allow the user to index their notes after logging in.
In a future iteration, the user would benefit from having the user notes
automatically index upon logging in.
